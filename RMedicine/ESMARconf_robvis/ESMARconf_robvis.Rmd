#  The robvis package 

R package and web app to create publication- quality risk-of-bias visualisations
Motivation: no tool available to reproducibly create these figures
Currently can produce two types of plots:
+ Traffic-light plots
	+ Summary barplots

---
#  Traffic-light plots

---
#  Summary bar-plots

---
#  Limitations of the current approach 

Risk-of-bias assessments are performed and the figures are relegated to the supplementary material
Better to try and “pair” the assessments to their respective results
Also suggested to perform sub-group meta-analysis by risk-of-bias level

#  Building on metafor 

“Paired” forest/risk-of-bias plots

#  metafor::forest() returns information on dimensions of the plot 

The metafor ::forest() function produces additional output beyond the plot itself
As seen on the last slide, assigning this output to a variable (e.g. forest_obj ) via
forest_obj <- metafor::forest(res)
means we can explore and use this information in subsequent functions
Output includes:
Limits of the forest plot ( xlim , ylim )
Axis limits (alim)
Where the breaks at the axis lie (at)
Other information needed for plotting

#  Take-home messages 

Keep an eye out for potential ways to build on existing evidence synthesis packages to expand user functionality
On the flip-side, think about how others might build on your packages (and what information they’ll need!)
Best option : develop packages in tandem, so that cross-talk between them is possible.

#  Future work 

New function ( rob_blobbogram () ) , which will automatically subset data by risk-of-bias level and perform a meta-analysis on each subset.
Draws on metafor and forester packages
