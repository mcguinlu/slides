# Intro to advanced topics


- Create __beautiful plots__ with `ggplot2`

???

__Don't forget to introduce yourself__

* NIHR DRF/PhD Student
* Working aross the IE/BARR, primary with Julian Higgins
* Work mainly on evidence synthesis methods

Just to note that this is a jumping off point for reference. 

Slides are available from the link in your folders - lots of elements in this presentation are hyper-linked, so might be worth having a look.

# Pretty plots: <br> Intro to `ggplot2`

---

# ggplot2

.Large[

A package to create __highly customisable publication-ready plots__

Key elements:

* .bold[aesthetic]: what you want to graph (e.g. x, y, colours, etc)

* .bold[geom]: how you want to graph it (e.g. scatterplot, histogram)

* .bold[options]: optional titles, themes, etc.

<br>

Elements are added together using **+**

]

???

Can do plots in base R, as Matt showed you earlier

Advantage of using ggplot is greater control over the layout

Base plots fine for doing simple exploratory figures - anything more, you'll want ggplot2

---

## The `bmi2` dataset
.large[
The dataset used for the following graphics contains 200 observations across the following six variables:
]

```{r, echo=FALSE, width = 800}

bmi2 <- tibble::tribble(
  ~id,  ~age,  ~bmi,      ~sex,    ~diet,         ~status,
   1, 78.2, 29.3,   "Male", "Good", "Unhealthy",
   2, 48.5,   33, "Female", "Good", "Unhealthy",
   3, 79.5, 31.5, "Female", "Good", "Unhealthy",
   4, 78.5, 28.1,   "Male", "Poor",   "Healthy"
  )

kable(head(bmi2[1:4,]),row.names = FALSE)
```

Install and load the `ggplot2` package, and download a copy of the dataset to follow along:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")

df <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/phd-intro-bmi2")
```

???

So we're going to jump right in and make a plot:

---

```{r, echo = F}
df <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/phd-intro-bmi2")
```

```{r christmas, eval=F, echo=F}
ggplot(data = df) +
aes(x = age) +
aes(y = bmi) +
geom_point() +
aes(colour = sex) +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
scale_color_manual(values = 
                     c("blue", "purple")) +
ylim(c(15, 35)) +
labs(x = "Age",
     y = "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
     colour = "") +
labs(title = "BMI by Age") +
labs(subtitle = "Colour indicates sex")
```

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F, eval = T, fig.show='hide'}
get_what_save_what <- "christmas"
eval(parse(text = paste(knitr:::knit_code$get(get_what_save_what), collapse = "")))
ggsave(paste0("figures/", get_what_save_what, ".png"), dpi = 700)
```


`r apply_reveal("christmas")`

---

```{r christmas8, eval=F, echo=F}
ggplot(data = df) +
aes(x = age) +
aes(y = bmi) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
theme_bw() +
theme_void() +
theme_classic() +
ggthemes::theme_economist() +
ggthemes::theme_stata()
```

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F, eval = T, fig.show='hide'}
get_what_save_what <- "christmas8"
eval(parse(text = paste(knitr:::knit_code$get(get_what_save_what), collapse = "")))
ggsave(paste0("figures/", get_what_save_what, ".png"), dpi = 700)
```

`r apply_reveal("christmas8")`

???

Rather than using predefined themes, going to showcase how you can edit specific elements of your plots

---

```{r christmas2, eval=F, echo=F}
ggplot(data = df) +
aes(x = status) +
geom_histogram(stat = "count") +
aes(fill = diet) +
labs(fill = "Diet status") +
labs(title = "Number of people by status",
     subtitle = "Colour indicates diet", 
     x = "Status", 
     y = "Number of people") +
theme(axis.title=element_text(colour="red"))+
theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="black")) +
theme(title = element_text(size = 20)) 
```

```{r, echo = F, warning=F, message=F, eval = T, fig.show='hide'}
get_what_save_what <- "christmas2"
eval(parse(text = paste(knitr:::knit_code$get(get_what_save_what), collapse = "")))
ggsave(paste0("figures/", get_what_save_what, ".png"), dpi = 700)
```

`r apply_reveal("christmas2")`

# Virtually endless customisability

Plots on previous slides are __only a taster__

Can make __any plot you can think up__

__Key resources__, all open-source:

* [`ggplot2` documentionation and cheatsheet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - great starting point.

* ["Data visualisation"](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy - great introductory text on the science of data visualization, with examples in R.

* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - weekly community-run visualization exercise

# Recap

.Large[

Key concept is that you are __adding elements together__:

- first the data 

- then the elements of the data you want to display (`aesthetics`)

- then the way you want to display them (`geoms`)

- then extra options (colour/themes/titles)

# Literate programming: <br> `RMarkdown`

---

# `RMarkdown`

.Large[

A single file (with `.Rmd` extension) that incorporates text, code and output (results and figures)

Can be converted to multiple formats:

* Word

* PDF

* HTML (web-page)

]

---

# Components of a `RMarkdown` file

.Large[

**A (optional) YAML header surrounded by three hyphens (---)**

* Defines metadata, such as the title, author and date
* Defines the output format (Word, PDF, HTML, etc.)

**Code chunks: R code chunks surrounded by backticks (`) **

* This is where the core computation happens
* Can choose to show the underlying code or just the results

** Text with inline code** 

* Great for presenting results as part of a sentence
* E.g. The mean of the age variable was `` `r
mean(age)` ``

# Why bother?


Improves __reproducibility__ and __transparency__, as the origin of every single result in the paper can be examined


???

Avoids errors in copying numerical results into a manuscript

--

Makes a lot of tasks more __straightforward__:

* Updating a manuscript with new __data/analyses__

* __Citing__ other work 

* Controlling __figure placement__

???

Prevents against the hell of word reshuffling everything if you move a figure

---

# Things you can produce using `RMarkdown`

.Large[

* Academic papers ([example](https://github.com/mcguinlu/data-availability-impact))

* Theses ([`bristolthesis`](https://github.com/mattlee821/bristolthesis))

* Supervisory reports (great if format is similar each time)

* Slides (this slide deck was made using `RMarkdown`!)

]

My github has examples of papers written using RMarkdown

# Making R accessible: <br> Intro to `shiny`

## What is .cb[`shiny`]?
.Large[
.cb[`shiny`] is an R package that allows users to __build interactive web applications__ ("apps") straight from R.

.pull-left[
`Shiny` apps are web-pages that users can interact with to: 

* Explore data

* Perform analyses

* Create plots

## Structure of a .cb[`shiny`] app


A .cb[`shiny`] app is a special type of `R` file that has three component:

* User interface
  
--

* Server

--

* Call to the .cb[`shinyApp`]


???

User interface
  * Defines the layout of your app
  * Controls what it looks like (themes/fonts/etc)

Server
  * Defines the logic needed to build the app
  * Performs computational work 

---

## How it works

.Large[Essentially using a __webpage__ rather than __console__ to instruct R]

.center[
<img src="figs/uiserver.png" width = 600 height=420>
]

---

## Why bother?

.Large[

* R has a __high barrier to entry__ for new users

* Apps allow those without any experience of R to __explore__ and __benefit__ from your work

* The more people who can use it, the __better known/cited__ it will be!

# Packaging your code

# Why package?

# Where to get/share packages?

**CRAN**

* Official repository  
* Strict submission process to guarantee quality
* `install.packages("packagename")`

**Bioconductor**

* Topic specific repository, with a focus on bioinformatics  
* Strict submission requirements, similar to CRAN
* `BiocManager::install("packagename")`

**GitHub**

* Popular for open source projects  
* Wild west of packages
* `devtools::install_github("username/packagename")`

# Wrapping up

__Common question: Why should I use R rather than STATA/SPSS/etc?__

R is __open-source__ and __free__ to use

--

Better __interface__

--

More __resources__

--

__Future-proofing__ for a career outside academia

???

Acknowledge that I am v.v. biased!

Employers are much more likely to want R/Python that STATA

However, acknowledge different learning curves with different programs.

STATA is designed to get you up and running quickly, but is then limited for more complex tasks

R has a steep initial learning curve, but really comes into it's own once you have a good grasp of the basics.

---

class: Large

# Wrapping up

Final points:

* Can do a __lot with R__, once you have a good grasp of the basics

--

* There is an __R package__ for pretty much everything you may want to do.

--

* Best way to learn is to __find a problem__ and try to __use R to solve it__.
