This is a short **document** to demonstrate the functionality of the Rmarkdown file.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

df <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/phd-intro-bmi2", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(df, 10)

mean_var <- "bmi"

```

There were `r ncol(df)` columns in the data. 

The mean of the `r mean_var` variable was `r mean(df[[mean_var]])`.
