# Introduction

This is a short **document** to *demonstrate* the functionality of the Rmarkdown file.

## Table of data

```{r, echo = FALSE}

df <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/phd-intro-bmi2", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(df, 10)

mean_variable <- "age"

```

## Summary statistics

There were `r ncol(df)` columns in the data. 

The mean of the `r mean_variable` variable was `r mean(df[[mean_variable]])`.
